-	Pointers	:-
	```
	-	The fact data science is young increases the probability of such scenarios happening to you as well:
		-	Management or part of it doesn’t buy in
		-	Resistance to data collection and analysis
		-	Rejection of forecasts, predictions and insights
		-	Treating you as a “number/Excel monkey”
		-	Thinking that any unsolved problem is your problem even if it doesn’t require any of your role defining skills.
			So how can you survive all this?

	-	Find friendlier managers and work with them.
	-	Do simple projects. Report results. Report value added.
	-	Focus on top management. "Be there" in meetings, conference calls etc.
	-	Be proactive. Launch new ideas.
	-	Help coworkers getting the data they need.
	-	Automate simple tasks
	-	Be extremely communicative.
	-	Be nice, explain everything clearly and help everyone
	-	Avoid jerks, for real
	-	Find a lightning rod absorbing damage in your stead.
	-	Requests Friday - for asking questions and clarification.
	-	Start emailing reports to people and later expect them to shift to your posts.
	-	The only thing you can’t buy is time.
	```
- Summary	:-
	```
	-	Remember that time management is the key
	-	Establish a weekly day to screen and process requests
	-	Give presentations, but find a way to spread knowledge more deeply and continuously
	-	Draw your processes and find a way to attach value to every project
	-	Try to stay lean and simple as long as you can

## Topic	-	*Do Your Data Scientists Know the ‘Why’ Behind Their Work?*
-	Subject		:	**Data Science**
-	Tags	:	**Data**, **Analytics**, **Business Problem / Objectives**, **Insights**
-	Link		:	https://hbr.org/2019/05/do-your-data-scientists-know-the-why-behind-their-work?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_source=Data_Elixir_234
-	Pointers	:-
>	1. In many companies, data scientists are not engaging in enough of this softer, but more difficult, work. Two underlying reasons contribute. First, many data scientists are much more interested in pursuing their crafts — namely, finding interesting nuggets buried in data — than they are in solving business problems. In some respects, this is natural. After all, they are taught a narrow focus on data and the tools needed to explore it, and doing so helps them earn peer recognition. Plus, applying advanced techniques is more fun than dealing with the messy realities of corporate life.

	> 2. The second reason: From the company’s perspective, the talent is rare and protecting data scientists from the chaos of everyday work just makes sense. But doing so increases the distance between data scientists and the company’s most important problems and opportunities. Exacerbating this, for many organizations, data scientists are new and unfamiliar, and companies are still learning how to manage them. It is tempting to bolt data science onto your existing organization and hope for the best.

	> So, what should managers do to get more from their data science programs?
	> 1. Clarify your business objectives and measure progress toward them.
	> 2. Hire data scientists best suited to the problems you face and immerse them in the day-in, day-out work of your organization.
	> 3. Demand that data scientists take end-to-end accountability for their work.
	> 4. Insist that data scientists teach others, both inside their departments and across the company.

	> Data science is a team sport, but it’s not a game. Managers must make clear that the goal is to improve the business, and they must hire those that can help them do so. They must do all they can to integrate data scientists into their teams and they must insist that data scientists contribute in every way possible — before, during, and after the technical work.

## Topic	-	*Elastic Search*
-	Subject	:	**Data Management**
-	Tags	:	**Data**, **Analytics Engine**, **NoSQL DB**, **Full Text Search Engine**
-	Link	:	https://bqstack.com/b/detail/31/Introduction-to-Elasticsearch
-	Support Link: https://medium.com/@anubioinfo/load-csv-data-into-elasticsearch-fdb562a7abd9
-	Pointers	:-     
> Elasticsearch is a full-text search engine which can be used as a NoSQL database and can be used as an analytics engine. It is easy to scale, schema-less, near real-time and provides a restful interface for different operations. It is schema-less and uses an inverted index for data storage. Elasticsearch is created in Java and built on top of Lucene.

	> Different use cases to use Elasticsearch are:    
	> 1. Online Web Store
	2. Price Alerting Platform
	3. Analytics / Business-intelligence
	4. Central Log Management
	5. Fraud Management
	6. System Monitoring
	7. E-commerce Search Solutions
	8. Visualizing Data
